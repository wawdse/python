Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where
I was gonna go next
Didn't know until I saw your face
I was missin' out on every moment
You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you
(I'm into you)
So if it's real
then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
if you steal the show
You and I, we go together
You're the sky, I'll be the weather
A pretty thing, the sun and rain, oh no
Oh, yeah
Summer night, perfect occasion
When am I? You know
I'll be waitin' for you
Oh, for you
So if it's real, then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind if you steal the show
So if it's real, then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind if you steal the show
You shine, you shine,
like forever lasts forever
You shine, you shine and steal the show
So if it's real, then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind if you steal the show
(Started out on a one-way train)
(Always knew where
I was gonna go next)
So if it's real, then, darlin', let me know
(Didn't know until I saw your face)
(I was missin' out on every moment)
