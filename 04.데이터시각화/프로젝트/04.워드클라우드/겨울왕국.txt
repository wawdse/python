The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like Im the queen
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldnt keep it in, heaven knows Ive tried
Dont let them in, dont let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, dont feel, dont let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Cant hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I dont care what theyre going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
Its funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me cant get to me at all
Its time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
Im free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
Youll never see me cry
Here I stand and here Ill stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
Im never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go, let it go
And Ill rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
