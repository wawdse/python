Imagine that you have just arrived at a hotel after a tiring 7-hour overnight flight.
At the front desk, the staff person welcomes you, gives you a warm smile,
confirms your reservation quickly and hands you your room key.
They tell you the complimentary breakfast is still being served in the dining room.
